/*
 * Since there's no API for the CETA Check, that I know of, this list is (for
 * now?) manually maintained.
 * Data: https://stop-ttip.org/cetacheck/
 * More info: the purpose here is to have on the list the MEPs who *did* reply
 * to the CETA Check, so we don't need to bother them anymore.
 * Contries: due to the manual nature of how this file is updated, it currently
 * only has the MEPs for the countries the website currently supports.
